            <h2 class="section-title">Built on Trust and Privacy</h2>
            <p class="section-description">
                We've built KOMAL on principles that put your child's wellbeing first. Every feature is designed 
                with privacy, trust, and ethical AI at its core.
            </p>
            <div class="principles-grid">
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>Privacy-First Design</h3>
                    <p>All processing happens on-device. Your child's data never leaves your device without explicit consent. 
                    We use the same privacy standards as FaceID and baby monitors—technology parents already trust.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>No Diagnosis, Just Understanding</h3>
                    <p>KOMAL provides insights, not diagnoses. We help you understand your child's learning patterns and 
                    emotional responses—we never label or categorize. This is behavioral understanding, not medical assessment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>Child-Specific Learning</h3>
                    <p>Every child is unique. KOMAL builds a personalized behavioral fingerprint for your child over time, 
                    learning their specific patterns, preferences, and responses. The more they use it, the better it understands them.</p>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>Secure and Transparent</h3>
                    <p>Your child's data is encrypted and secure. Parents have full control over what's shared and with whom. 
                    We're transparent about how our AI works—no black boxes, just clear explanations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>Works Offline</h3>
                    <p>Core learning features work without internet. Real-time adaptation happens on-device using advanced mobile GPUs. 
                    Your child's privacy and learning never depend on connectivity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle-card">
                    <h3>Parent-Controlled Sharing</h3>
                    <p>You decide who sees your child's insights. Share reports with teachers, therapists, or family members 
                    with one click. Every share is parent-initiated and parent-controlled.</p>

                We're not building another kids app. We're building the first AI system that understands children 
                the way a good educator does—at global scale, on consumer devices, with trust.

                    Children's learning apps are blind. They measure completion, not cognition. Points, streaks, and levels 
                    miss the real signal: attention drift, emotional overload, avoidance, hesitation.
                </p>

                    KOMAL flips the stack—from content-driven to signal-driven learning. We use real-time behavioral AI 
                    to read how your child feels, not just what they click. This creates a personalized learning experience 
                    that adapts moment-by-moment, just like a great teacher would.

                <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8;">
                    Our vision is to become the standard behavioral interface for childhood learning. Any learning experience 
                    can plug into KOMAL's signal layer to understand: Is the child engaged? Is this too hard? Is this helping? 
                    That is a platform outcome, not just an app outcome.

                    <h3>What is KOMAL?</h3>
                    <p>KOMAL is a hyper-personalized learning companion for children ages 3-12 that uses real-time behavioral AI 
                    to understand how your child feels and learns. Unlike traditional apps that only track clicks, KOMAL reads 
                    gaze patterns, touch interactions, and micro-expressions to adapt learning moment-by-moment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does KOMAL protect my child's privacy?</h3>
                    <p>Privacy is our top priority. All AI processing happens on-device—your child's data never leaves your device 
                    without explicit consent. We use the same privacy standards as FaceID and baby monitors. Parents have full control 
                    over what's shared and with whom. We never sell data or use it for advertising.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does KOMAL diagnose my child?</h3>
                    <p>No. KOMAL provides insights and understanding, not medical or psychological diagnoses. We help you understand 
                    your child's learning patterns and emotional responses. We never label, categorize, or make diagnostic claims. 
                    This is behavioral understanding, not medical assessment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What age is KOMAL designed for?</h3>
                    <p>KOMAL is designed for children ages 3-12. The AI adapts to each child's developmental stage, learning style, 
                    and individual needs. Younger children get simpler interactions and more visual cues, while older children engage 
                    with more complex learning activities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the real-time adaptation work?</h3>
                    <p>KOMAL uses advanced mobile GPUs to process behavioral signals in real-time (under 200ms latency). When your 
                    child hesitates, shows frustration, or loses attention, the app instantly adapts by slowing down, changing tone, 
                    adjusting difficulty, or introducing calming micro-games—all automatically.</p>

                    <h3>What do the parent reports include?</h3>
                    <p>Every week, you receive a simple 1-minute report in plain language. It explains what KOMAL observed about your 
                    child's learning patterns, emotional responses, and engagement levels. Reports include actionable insights like 
                    "Your child shows more confidence with visual tasks" or "They may benefit from shorter sessions."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I share reports with my child's teacher or therapist?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, absolutely. You control who sees your child's insights. With one click, you can share reports via email 
                    or WhatsApp with teachers, therapists, or family members. Every share is parent-initiated and parent-controlled.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does KOMAL work offline?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Core learning features work without internet. Real-time adaptation happens entirely on-device. You only 
                    need internet to receive weekly reports and sync data across devices (if you choose to).</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is KOMAL different from other learning apps?</h3>
                    <p>Most apps measure completion (points, streaks, levels) but miss real signals like attention drift, emotional 
                    overload, or growing confidence. KOMAL flips this—we're signal-driven, not content-driven. We read behavior in 
                    real-time and adapt instantly, like a great teacher would.</p>

                    <h3>Is there a free trial?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Our Free plan lets you try KOMAL with basic features. You can upgrade to Family plan ($9/month) anytime 
                    for advanced personalization and detailed insights. No credit card required to start.</p>
